                            A strawberry is a fruit that is the member of the rose family Rosaceae. There are
                            more than 20 different species and many hybrids and cultivars. The taste of
                            strawberries varies by cultivar. They can vary from sweet to tart.

                            Strawberries are not actual berries. Berries are fruts that do not split apart at
                            maturity, are derived from a single ovary, and their whole walls are fleshy. A
                            strawberry is known as a pseudocarp, or "false fruit." It is actually multiple
                            fruits made up of tiny individiual fruits that are embeded in a fleshy container.
                            The tiny little spots on the outside of the fruit are commonly known as seeds;
                            however, they are the true fruits. These are called achenes, and each of these
                            achenes surround a single seed.

                            Strawberries are native to the Americas. The indigenous peoples of North America
                            used them in many different dishes. After the Colombian Exchange, strawberries were
                            shipped back to Europe in the early 1600s. Another variety of the strawberry was
                            found in central and South America. The conquistadors called them "futilla," and
                            people did not bother cultivating them because they were so abundant in the wild.
                        <p id="info3">
                            Strawberries are hybrids of two different parent species. This allows them to
                            withstand a wide variety of temperatures. This is why strawberries are cultivated
                            in all 50 states. Florida and California are the largest U.S. producers. They are
                            also a significant crop in Pennsylvania; however, their season only lasts about 3
                            and a half weeks.

                            Strawberries can be eaten straight out of hand, or they can be used in a wide
                            variety of dishes. Very common ways uses of strawberries are in tarts and pies.
                            Other ways to use them are in muffins, breads, jams, jellies, preserves, and
                            sauces. Fresh strawberries can also be used in salads and smoothies, too.
                            Freezing the strawberries is also a very common practice and works well for
                            smoothies.

                            Strawberries are among the most widely grown fruit in a home garden, so they can
                            be cultivated in a wide variety of ecosystems. They can withstand a wide variety of
                            temperatures because they are a hybrid of two different parent species. For the
                            best yields, strawberries require well drained soil that is high in organic matter
                            and full sun (at least 6 hours per day). Strawberries should not be planted where
                            peppers, tomatoes, eggplants, or potatoes have previously been grown. This is
                            because these plants have the potential to carry a serious strawberry disease known
                            as <i>verticillium wilt</i>. Strawberries should be given one inch of water per
                            week while it is being grown.
